1)Cloud Computing :-

•	Cloud computing is the delivery of online services (such as servers, databases, software) to users.
  With the help of cloud computing, storing data on local machines is not required. 
•	It helps you access data from a remote server. 
•	Moreover, it is also used to store and access data from anywhere across the world


2)Deployment model in cloud :-

I) Public Cloud:

i) In a public cloud model, cloud resources and services are owned and operated by a third-party cloud service provider
and made available to the general public or a large customer base. 
ii) These services are delivered over the internet and can be accessed by anyone with an internet connection and the necessary credentials.
iii) Examples of public cloud providers include Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and IBM Cloud.

II) Private Cloud:

i) A private cloud is a cloud infrastructure and services that are dedicated to a single organization. 
ii) It can be hosted on-premises within an organization's data center or hosted by a third-party provider.
iii) Private clouds offer greater control, security, and customization compared to public clouds. 
They are often chosen by organizations with specific compliance, security, or performance requirements.

III) Hybrid Cloud:

i) A hybrid cloud combines elements of both public and private clouds, allowing data and applications to be shared between them. 
It provides greater flexibility by enabling workloads to move between the public and private environments.
ii) Organizations use hybrid clouds for various reasons, such as achieving cost savings, maintaining data sovereignty, or scaling resources during peak demand.
iii) Hybrid cloud deployments can be complex, as they require integration between public and private cloud environments. 
Tools and technologies like cloud orchestration and containerization help manage these deployments effectively.

IV)Community Cloud:

i)A community cloud is shared by multiple organizations or entities with common interests, 
such as industry-specific compliance requirements or regulatory concerns.
ii) These clouds are tailored to meet the needs of a particular community or group of organizations. 
They offer the benefits of cloud computing while addressing shared concerns.
iii)Community clouds can be managed by one organization or a third-party provider and are often used in sectors like healthcare, education, or government.
